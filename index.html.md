### <a id="cluster-components"></a>Understanding Cluster Components ###

See [Managing Your Cluster](managing_your_cluster.html) for a description of the different components deployed by this product, and how they can be scaled up and down depending on your requirements.

### <a id="service-plan"></a>Service Plan ###

The service offers a single service plan called **developer** suitable for development workloads. Provisioning a service instance creates a private Riak CS bucket. Binding applications to the instance creates unique credentials for each application to access the bucket.

There are no storage quotas on individual buckets. Service capacity is limited by persistent storage allocated to the Riak CS nodes; this defaults to 10GB but can be configured by the Operations Manager user.

## <a id="provision-and-bind"></a>Provisioning and Binding via Cloud Foundry ##

Once you have installed the product, it automatically registers itself with your Elastic Runtime. At this point, the product is available to your application developers, either in the Marketplace in the web based console, or via `cf marketplace`. They can add, provision, and bind the service to their applications like any other CF service:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-service p-riakcs developer mybucket
$ cf bind-service myapp mybucket
$ cf restart myapp
</pre>

### <a id="example-app"></a>Example Application ###

An example application, written in Ruby and using the Fog library, can be [downloaded here](riakcs-example-app.tgz). Once you've downloaded and unpacked the tarball, see the included README for instructions.

## Backing Up and Restoring

Using [riak-backup](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-riak-cs-release/tree/master/scripts/riak-backup/src/riak_backup), administrators can back up data from all buckets as a batch process. This tool is distributed as [compiled binaries for linux and OSX](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-riak-cs-release/tree/master/scripts/riak-backup/bin) (not available for Windows at this time), and requires the `cf` CLI and [s3cmd](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-riak-cs-release/blob/master/docs/clients.md#s3cmd) to be independently installed.

Data can be restored one bucket at a time, by admins or end users themselves, using [s3cmd](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-riak-cs-release/blob/master/docs/clients.md#s3cmd). Backup data is stored in a directory tree organized by organization, spaces, and service instances. A metadata file for each instance includes which applications were bound to it.
